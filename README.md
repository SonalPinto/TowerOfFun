#TowerOfFun

Hosts the Tower of Fun project!
Much fun abound...

I have hosted it on bitballoon : [toweroffun.bitballoon.com/](http://toweroffun.bitballoon.com/)

I mostly document this on my blog - [Tower of Fun](http://robotcantalk.blogspot.in/p/blog-page.html)

Tower of Fun is going to be a infinite procedurally generated top-down shump roguelike with probably some unique features that I have in mind. Too many keywords... ya, I am aware. 

I shall document the progress and stash versions in their own subDirs (in ./games/).
All assets and common JS are stored in ./assets/ and ./libs/
