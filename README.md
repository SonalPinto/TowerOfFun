TowerOfFun
==========

Hosts the Tower of Fun project!
Much fun abound...

I mostly document this on my blog - [Project: Tower of Fun]( http://robotcantalk.blogspot.in/2014/09/project-tower-of-fun.html)

Tower of Fun is going to be a infinite procedurally generated top-down shump roguelike with probably some unique features that I have in mind. Too many keywords... ya, I am aware. 

I shall document the progress and stash versions in their own subDirs (in ./games/).
All assets and common JS are stored in ./assets/ and ./libs/
